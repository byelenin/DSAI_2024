# Case #1: Alternative economic indicators

- **Question**: How do we measure a country's economic performance without published or convincing statistic, like North Korea?

- **Answer**: Use alternative indicators, such as satellite images of nighttime lights, to estimate economic activity.

# What is the Data Science?

- **My Own View**

--

&gt;"All knowledge and skills of gaining and communicating insights from complex data through digital techniques. It is a blend of principles, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data."

--

- Main contents of Data Science:

  - **Data Collection**: surveys, sensors, web scraping and OCR etc. 
  
--
  
  - **Data Wrangling** : cleaning, transforming, merging,filtering, aggregating, and summarizing.

--

  - **Data Analysis**  : descriptive statistics, causal inference, and predictive analytics.

--
  - **Data Visualization** : graphs, charts, and maps.

--

  - **Data Communication** : reports, dashboards, and presentations

--

- As a student that analyzes data, most of it you do already. However...


???

-  there is no such a course that systematically teaches you how to do it.

# What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

- **AI**, thus the *Artificial Intelligence*, is a field of computer science that aims to create machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

--

- **Many Areas**:
  
  - Machine Learning
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Computer Vision
  - Robotics
  - Expert Systems

--


- The most influential breakthrough in AI recently is in the space of .hi-pink[**Generative AI**] models or the .hi-pink[**Large Language Models**(LLM)]

--

  - which are designed to create text or other forms of media based on patterns and examples they have been trained on such as **ChatGPT** and many others.


--
- It is dramatically changing the lives of human beings, and so is how we do research.



???

- open sources or company own

# Revolutions in Social Science 

- Social sciences(*firstly started by Economics*) have experienced two methodological **revolutions** over the past few decades. 

--

.pull-left[   

- .hi-pink[**No.1: Credibility Revolution**]

  - A movement that emphasizes the goal of obtaining secure causal inferences in social sciences.(Angrist and Pischke, 2010)
  
  - The revolution started from around the 1990s, pioneering in economics, then spread over to other empirical social sciences such as sociology, political science, education, public policy, etc., which has entirely changed empirical social science and business research.

]


.pull-right[   

&lt;img src="Figs/NewNoble1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
    
]


???

- Before the revolution, researchers frequently relied on attempts to statistically model the world to make inferences from observational data.

    - In essence, they would rely heavily on ex post statistical analysis to make causal inferences. Now we have acknowledged that this is not a "real" causal inference.
    
- The revolution centered around the idea that the only way to truly account for possible sources of bias is to remove the influence of all confounders ex ante through better research design.

    - Thus, since the revolution, researchers have attempted to design studies around sources of random or as-if random variation, either with experiments or what have become known as **quasi-experimental** designs.

- The revolution started from around 1990s pioneering in economics then spread over other empirical social sciences such as sociology, political science, education, legal studies, etc, which has entirely changed empirical social science.

- The name of Big Data comes from computer scientists working to do aggregation on data that is too big to fit on a single machine.

- The Big Data presents exciting opportunities for the study of social science, but at the same time its size and heterogeneity present significant challenges.

- Big Data analytic tools are highly correlated with econometrics

    - partially straight out of previous statistics and econometrics classes(Cluster, Regression and Matching)
    - some are totally new(such as decision trees and neural networks)

# Why Economics needs Data Science and AI


--

.pull-left[

- Economics and Data Science have many in common

  - require strong analytical skills
  - rely heavily on data and statistical analysis
  - need domain knowledge to interpret results

]

.pull-right[

- The main difference between Economics and Data Science

1. Data collection and processing 

  - Econ: more **structured** and **cleaned** 
  - DS: more **unstructured** and **messy**
  
2. methods and tools

  - Econ: more **theoretical** and **causal inference** 
  - DS: more **practical** and **prediction**
  
]

---

# Why Economics needs Data Science and AI

- Data Science can be seen as a **complement** to Economics, providing new tools and methods to analyze data and extract insights that may not be possible with traditional econometric methods alone.

--

- Economics theory and Econometrics methods can also provide a **foundation** for Data Science, helping to guide the analysis and interpretation of data. 

--

- The combination of Economics and Data Science can lead to more **robust** and **comprehensive** analyses that can provide valuable insights into complex economic and social issues.

--

- **AI revolution** especially the GAI or LLM models are the result of the developing combination of Social Science, Data Science and Computer Science.

--

- It is dramatically changing the way we do research in Economics and Data Science 

  - With the help with AI tools, we can finish the work in Data Science and Economics more .hi-pink[efficiently and accurately].

# An Introduction to Economic Data


---

# Two Axioms of Data Analysis

--

- **Axiom 1**: Any economy can be seen as a .hi-pink[stochastic process] governed by a certain probability law.

    - The economy's future state is not deterministic but can be described in terms of probabilities.

--

- **Axiom 2**: Economic phenomena, often summarized in form of data, can be interpreted as a .hi-pink[realization] of this stochastic data generating process.

    - By studying historical data, we can infer patterns, trends, and the probability distributions that describe the stochastic process, thereby gaining insights into the economy's underlying dynamics. 

--

- It highlights the importance of probabilistic models in economics and provides a theoretical basis to use statistical tools and models to analyze economic data.
   
???

Axiom 1 suggests that an economy, with all its complexity and dynamics, can be modeled as a stochastic process. 

- This axiom recognizes the inherent uncertainty and variability in economic activities, influenced by countless factors such as individual decisions, policy changes, external shocks, and technological advancements.

Axiom 2 builds on the first axiom by stating that the economic data we observe and collect—ranging from stock prices to GDP growth rates—are not just random numbers but are manifestations or "realizations" of the underlying stochastic process that governs the economy. 

- This perspective is crucial for econometric analysis, as it implies that by studying historical data, we can infer patterns, trends, and the probability distributions that describe the stochastic process, thereby gaining insights into the economy's underlying dynamics.

# What is Data

--

- Data is a collection of facts or information, which can be presented in various forms such as *numbers*, *tables*, *words*, *graphs*, *pictures*, or even *sounds* and *videos*. 

--

- And it can be processed and analyzed to produce knowledge and insights either by itself or after structuring, cleaning, and analysis.

--

- Data is most straightforward to analyze if it forms a single **data table**(a matrix). 

  - It consists of **observations**(观测值) and **variables**(变量). 
  
  - Observations are also known as cases, or row. 
  
  - Variables are sometimes called features or covariates.

--

- Normally, in a data table the *rows are the observations*, *columns are variables*.

- Content: measure the degree to which the data represents the underlying phenomenon.
- Accuracy: measure the degree of closeness between the data and the true value.
- Completeness: measure the degree to which all required data is present.
- Consistency: measurement of a variable should be stable, leading to the same value if measured the same way again.

# Data Types

--

.pull-left[

### Experimental V.S. Observational Data

- **Experimental** data come from experiments designed to evaluate a treatment or policy or to investigate a causal effect.


- **Observational** data come from non-experimental settings, such as surveys,administrative records and other sources.

]

--

.pull-right[

### Data Structure

  - Cross-sectional data
  - Time series data
  - Panel/longitudinal data
  - Pool-cross sectional data

]

???

- **Experimental** data are collected by randomly assigning treatments to subjects and then comparing the outcomes of the treated and untreated subjects.

    - relatively randomized 
    - Normally but not necesarrily small sample size.
    - more clean and less noise but far from real world.

- **Observational** data are collected by observing the subjects in their natural environment, without any intervention or manipulation by the researcher.

    - not randomized.
    - large sample size.
    - close to real world but with much noise and bias.

---
# 1.Cross-Sectional Data: (Major Focus)

--

- Units: individuals, households, firms, cities, states, countries, etc. 

--

- Data on multiple agents at a single point in time
`$$\{x_{i},y_{i}...\}_{i=1}^{N};N=Sample\,Size$$`

--

- Usually obtained by random sampling from the underlying population.It means 
`$$\{x_{i},y_{i}\perp x_{j},y_{j}\},i\neq j\in N$$`

--

- Cross-sectional data are widely used in economics and other social sciences: 

    - labor economics, public finance, industrial economics, urban economics, health economics...

---
# 1.Cross-Sectional Data: (Major Focus)

&lt;img src="Figs/Data_table1.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

- **Questions?**: observations,variables,the sample size?
--
`$$x_i=STRatio_i;\:y_i=TestScore_i;\:N=420$$`
---
# 2.Time Series Data:(Minor Cover)

--

- Observations on a variable (or several variables) over time, thus data on a single agent at multiple points in time
`$$\{x_{t},y_{t}...\}_{t=1}^{T};T=Sample\,Size$$`

--

- Examples: 

  - stock prices, money supply 

  - consumer price index(CPI) 

  - gross domestic product(GDP) 

  - automobile sales 

--

- Data frequency: minutes, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually. 

--

- Economic observations can rarely be assumed to be independent across time. So we have to account for the dependent nature of economic time series. 



---
# 2.Time Series Data:(Minor Cover)

&lt;img src="Figs/Data_table2.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- **Questions?** observations,variables,the sample size?
--
`$$x_{t}=Date(quarter);\:y_{t}=GDP\;Growth\;Rate;\:N(T)=213$$`


---

# 3.Panel or Longitudinal Data(Minor Cover)

--

- Time series for each cross-sectional member in the data set, thus data on multiple agents at multiple points in time.

--

- The same cross-sectional units (individuals, firms, countries, etc.) are followed over a given time period. `$$\{x_{it},y{}_{it}...\}_{i=1,t=1,}^{NT}$$`

--

- Advantages of panel data: 

    - Controlling for (time-invariant) unobserved characteristics 

    - Consideration of the effects of lag variables

---
# 3.Panel(or Longitudinal) Data(Minor Cover)

&lt;img src="Figs/Data_table3.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

- **Questions?**: observations,variables,the sample size?
`$$x_{it}=Total\;Taxes_{it};\:y_{it}=Cigarette\;Sales_{it};\:N\times T=48\times11=528$$`
---
# 4.Pool Cross-Sectional Data(Not Cover)

- Pooled cross sections can be generated by combining two or more years cross-sectional data. 

--

  - Cross-sectional data in each year is independent with other years. 

  - While the data come from a same population in different time,the data does not necessarily track the respondent multiple times. 

--

- For it has both cross-sectional and time series features, so allows consideration of changes in key variables over time. 

- Simple pooling may also be used when the number of observations of a single cross section is small. 

--

- It is widely used in: 

    - Cohort studies 
    - Difference-in-differences analyses
    - Cross-sectional analyses


---
# 4.Pool Cross-Sectional Data(Not Cover)

&lt;img src="Figs/Data_table4.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- **Questions?**: observations,variables,the sample size?
`$$x_{ijt}=hprice_{i,1993},hprice_{j,1995};y_{ijt}=proptex_{i,1993},proptex_{j,1995};\\
N=N_{i}+N_{j}=250+270=520$$`
