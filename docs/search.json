Topics covered include spatial data analysis, web scraping and text analysis, OCR and text recognition, and machine learning techniques. Unlike traditional econometrics courses, the focus is on using real-world examples and hands-on projects to develop students’ ability to work with non-traditional economic data.\nThe course prioritizes practical skills and intuition over theoretical or mathematical rigor, allowing students to gain experience with modern data science tools without being overwhelmed by complex equations. The goal is to equip students with the skills needed to apply data science and AI methods in their research and critically assess empirical studies that utilize these techniques.\nSpecifically, students will learn how to use various data science and AI tools to analyze non-traditional data sources and make reliable predictions about economic and social relationships. This course is designed to help students become more competitive in the field of economic research in the digital age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledge"

Many strategies in machine learning are explicitly designed to reduce this test error, possibly at the expense of increased training error. These strategies are collectively known as regularisation and they are instrumental for good performance of any kind of prediction or classification model, especially in the context of small data (many features, few samples).\nIn the hands-on tutorial we will use R to perform an integrated analysis of multi-omics data with penalised regression.\n\nContact\nInstructor A: contact\nInstructor B: contact\nInstructor C: contact"
