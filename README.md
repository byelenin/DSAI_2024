## Course Description

This course introduces students to the foundational concepts of data science and artificial intelligence, emphasizing their practical applications in economics and social sciences. Topics covered include **spatial data analysis**, **web scraping**, **text analysis**, **OCR and text recognition**.Unlike traditional econometrics courses, the focus is on using real-world examples and hands-on projects to develop students’ ability to work with non-traditional economic data.

The course prioritizes practical skills and intuition over theoretical or mathematical rigor, allowing students to gain experience with modern data science tools without being overwhelmed by complex equations. The goal is to equip students with the skills needed to apply data science and AI methods in their research and critically assess empirical studies that utilize these techniques.

Specifically, students will learn how to use various data science and AI tools to analyze non-traditional data sources and make reliable predictions about economic and social relationships. This course is designed to help students become more competitive in the field of economic research in the digital age.
